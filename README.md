# P42 Pico M.2

A RPi Pico RP2350A microcontroller board in m.2 3024 form factor with A and E key. The m.2 interface has USB, UART, I2C and control IO connectivity. Voltage levels for the m.2 specification are obeyed as some of the interfaces run on 1.8 V. Externally, +3.3 V, GND, the SWD interface and 16 IOs are accessible on castellated pins. A footprint for a QWIIC connector is on the top side of the board, not populated to have the board as low profile as possible. Power rail LEDs and a user controlled LED is on board, as well as a solder bridge for configuration options. Bottom side has a micro-SD card slot for data storage.
A microcontroller could give any host computer flexible and excellent real-time IO and data processing capabilities. The RPi Pico with its programmable PIO interface has excellent timing resolution.
